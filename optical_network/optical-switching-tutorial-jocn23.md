Optical switching will innovate intra data center networks
## Summary

- For hybrid network, the target latency of ocs is around 10 microsecond.
- OCS could simplify network into single-tier network
- Best solution of ocs: combination of space and wavelength
- Simple and low-latency control mechanism
