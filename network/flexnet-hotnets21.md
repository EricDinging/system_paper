# [A Vision for Runtime Programmable Networks](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~chenang/papers/hotnets-2021-flexnet.pdf)
## Problem
- Programmable network, specifically data plane
    - Current work mostly focus on compile-time programmability
## Challenges
- Whole-network programming
- Programming runtime changes
- Compiling fungible programs
- Compiling runtime changes
- Piloting runtime programmable networks
## Backgrounds

## Observations

## Ideas
- Runtime programming of individual devices
- Synchronized reconfigurations across the network
- The software controller initiates centralized management operations, but they are handed over to data plane hardware when feasible for efficient, distributed execution.
