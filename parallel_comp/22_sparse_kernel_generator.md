# An Efficient Sparse Kernel Generator for O(3)-Equivariant Deep Networks

## Please write a summary of the paper [from 3 to 6 sentences].
The paper introduces a GPU sparse kernel generator for the Clebsch-Gordon (CG) tensor product. It provides significant speedups over the best existing open and closedsource implementations. This is achieved through minimizing reads and writes to global memory by using shared memory and maximizing instruction-level parallelism.

## Please highlight the strengths of the paper [from 3 to 6 sentences, "NA" is not an acceptable response, every work has some strengths].
- The problem that the paper addresses is significant. The CG operation is a major bottleneck experienced millions of times by equivariant models.
- The solution outperforms close-source implementation by 4.8x in forward pass and 3x in backward pass.
- The generated kernel is sparsity-aware. 

## Please highlight the weaknesses of the paper [from 3 to 6 sentences, "NA" is not an acceptable response, every work has some weaknesses].
- The solution is based on FP32 and FP64 cores in GPUs, without exploring other low-precision cores for efficiency.
- The compilation process (JIT) and related instruction is hardcoded. The paper does not offer detailed explanation.

## Please provide a question for in-class discussion.
How might using lower precision formats (such as FP16 or INT8) impact the performance and accuracy of the CG tensor product?

## Please provide a question for in-class discussion.
Can we adapt sparsity-aware kernel generation to otehr deep learning models that use sparse matrices.
