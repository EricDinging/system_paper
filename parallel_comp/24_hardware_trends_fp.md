# Hardware Trends Impacting Floating-Point Computations In Scientific Applications

## Please write a summary of the paper [from 3 to 6 sentences].
The paper shows the trend that hardwares are increasingly adopting reduced-precision floating point processing units. And it discusses the trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and precision for ML and HPC workloads. It also show other trends such as the emerging specialized hardware.

## Please highlight the strengths of the paper [from 3 to 6 sentences, "NA" is not an acceptable response, every work has some strengths].
- The paper sheds light on energy-efficiency aspect of computing.
- The paper compares AI workloads with HPC workloads and offers great insights about their different requirements on the hardware.
- The paper shows the software requirement on moving towards heterogeneous computing environments.

## Please highlight the weaknesses of the paper [from 3 to 6 sentences, "NA" is not an acceptable response, every work has some weaknesses].
- The paper does not discuss the challenges of implementing reduced-precision techniques in existing HPC workloads that were designed for higher precision.
- The discussion of error detection mechanisms for reduced-precision floating-point operations is limited.
- The paper does not talk about infrastructure cost.


## Please provide a question for in-class discussion.
- Does different AI workloads (training vs. inference) also require heterogeneous clusters?
