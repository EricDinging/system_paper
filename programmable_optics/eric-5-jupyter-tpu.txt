# Jupiter Evolving: Transforming Googleâ€™s Datacenter Network via Optical Circuit Switches and Software-Defined Networking

## Summary
This paper introduced a network fabric based on OCS that is incrementally deployable.  The researchers use the combination of traffic and topology engineering to achieve similar throughput as Clos fabrics using direct-connect fabrics. The minimum latency of flows is dropped by 7-11% and 24% for 99% tail latency.

## Pros
- The paper introduces a very interesting motivation: updating spine layer for optimal performance for all blocks is resource-intensive, so it might as well be removed entirely.
- Hierarchical OCS for failure domain minimization.

## Cons
- The decision-making behind topology and traffic engineering is not clear. It seems that most of the time the cluster will use traffic engineering.
- The central controller may not scale well.

# TPU v4: An Optically Reconfigurable Supercomputer for Machine Learning with Hardware Support for Embeddings

## Summary
This paper introduced TPUv4 supercomputer architecture. The supercomputer uses proprietary chips, interconnected by direct-connect fabrics within a block and across blocks. The intra-block interconnect uses electrical mesh network, and the inter-block interconnect uses OCSes to implement direct-connected topology.

## Pros
- The researchers address the fault tolerance measures using indirect routing.
- The research demonstrates a successful large-scale deployment of OCSes.

## Cons
- The exact routing strategy is not clearly defined.
- The scale is bottlenecked by the number of ports on the OCS.
