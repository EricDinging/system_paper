# Optimizing Bulk Transfers with Software-Defined Optical WAN

## Summary
Owan is a traffic management system that optimizes wide-area bulk transfers with centralized joint control of the optical and network layers.
Owan completes transfers up to 4.45×faster on average, and up to 1.36×more transfers meet their deadlines

## Pros
1. Deadline-driven controller minimizes end-to-end latency.
2. Implemented on commodity testbed.

## Cons
1. The paper does not specify application deadlines.
2. Data transfer size distribution in evaluation is not an actual reflection of actual workloads.
