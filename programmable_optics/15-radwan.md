# RADWAN: Rate Adaptive Wide Area Network

## Summary
The paper argues that most of the optical fibers in WAN can achieve higher capacity due to low SNR. It also points out a conflicting point that operating at capacity threshold leads to higher failure rate. It also argues that rate adaptive design is suitable for optical links due to their stability and observability. The paper introduces RADWAN, a traffic engineering system that dynamically adjust link rates to enhance network throughput and availability.

## Pros
1. Analyze an important challenge of dynamic capacity reconfiguration: hitless capacity change.
2. The TE minimizes churn in addition to maximize throughput.

## Cons
1. The paper does not discuss the scalability of TE, especially SNR measurements.
2. The ILP formulation does not take into account signal transmission distance constraint.
