# RADWAN: Rate Adaptive Wide Area Network

## Summary
The paper argues that most of the optical fibers in WAN can achieve higher capacity due to low SNR. It also points out a conflicting point that operating at capacity threshold leads to higher failure rate. It also argues that rate adaptive design is suitable for optical links due to their stability and observability.

## Pros
1. Analyze one of the fundamental challenge of dynamic capacity reconfiguration: hitless capacity change.
2. The TE also minimizes churn in addition to maximize throughput.

## Cons
1. The paper does not discuss the scalability of TE, especially SNR measurements.

## Question
1. Difference between flow and tunnel
