# InterTubes: A Study of the US Long-haul Fiber-optic Infrastructure

## Summary

The paper build a map of optical infrastructure. The researchers show how to reduce risk and latency by deploying new links along previously unused transportation corridors. They conclude that focusing on a subset of high-risk links is sufficient to improve the overall robustness of the network to failures.

## Pros
- Create a map of optical infrastructure using publicly available data and traceroutes measurements.
- Develop a model to infer additional peering (hops) that can improve the overall robustness of the network.

## Cons
- Would love to see they have a macro-benchmark based on simulation for their design.
