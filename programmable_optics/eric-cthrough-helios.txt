# c-Through: part-time optics in data centers

## Summary
The paper introduces C-Through, a hybrid data center network consisting of electrical and optical networking planes. The electrical networking plane is used for small, latency-sensitive flows, while the optical networking plane is used for big, bandwidth-sensitive flows. C-Through relies on end-hosts for traffic monitoring and de-multiplexing instead of applications and switches, making it easy to implement.

## Pros
1. C-Through implements traffic measurement and control in end-host kernel without the need of application changes, leading to its ease of implementation.
2. C-Through can scale theoretically to 1000 racks in datacenters.

## Cons
1. This work has not been implemented over real OCS switch.
2. This work has not discussed the maximum duration one flow could wait for a link to be established.
3. There is no evaluation/simulation on scalability.

## Future work
1. Develop switch-based traffic monitoring and de-multiplexing
2. Develop protocols that could operate on top of fast-changing topologies with a circuit visit delay.
3. Implement broadcast/multi-cast using optical network.
4. Explore application and circuit switching (topology) co-design.


# Helios: A Hybrid Electrical/Optical Switch Architecture for Modular Data Centers

## Summary
Helios is a hybrid datacenter network design that integrates both optical and electrical switching components. This architecture aims to leverage the strengths of both technologies to create a more efficient and flexible network infrastructure for modular data centers.


## Pros
1. No modifaction is needed by Helios for application and end hosts.
2. The paper quantifies the benefit of cost and power, which are important metrics.
3. The paper demonstrates the need for optical switching by addressing the issue of underutilization in full-bisection bandwidth scenarios
4. The architecture provides a distinct separation of traffic between the electrical and optical planes, allowing for optimized routing and resource allocation.

## Cons
1. Scalability of topology manager is not addressed.
2. The work has not evaluated actual workload

## Future work
1. Explore the integration of Helios with SDN.
2. Research methods to enhance the scalability of the topology manager, possibly through distributed management approaches.
3. Transport layer with switching layer integration.
4. Performance vs. fairness for optical switching.
