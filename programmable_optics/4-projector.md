# ProjecToR: Agile Reconfigurable Data Center Interconnect

## Summary
ProjecToR is a free-space optics-based system for data center interconnects that leverages digital micromirror devices (DMDs) and photodetectors to establish dynamic, reconfigurable links between racks.
ProjecTor uses a two-category network topology: one based on short-term opportunistic links for large traffic and the other based on long-term dedicated links for small traffic.
It uses a scalable algorithm based on stable matching for two-tiered scheduling problem: creating links on Tx-Rx pairs for traffic demand between ToR pairs.
ProjecTor improves mean flow completion time by 30–95% and reduces cost by 25–40%.
## Pros
1. ProjecTor has a very short reconfiguration time. Links can be reconfigured in just 12 microseconds
2. A working prototype is built demonstrating the feasibility of deployment.

## Cons
1. Disruptions from dust, vibrations, or physical obstructions are not addressed.
2. ProjecTor is not compared against hybrid networks like C-Through or Helios in evaluation.
