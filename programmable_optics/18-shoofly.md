# Cost-effective capacity provisioning in wide area networks with Shoofly

## Summary
The authors point out that 50% of the cross-region traffic in WAN is pass-through. However, the traffic requires optical-electrical-optical conversion, incurring hardware cost. The authors propose Shoofly to find optical bypass opportunities to reduce conversion and thus reduce hardware cost while making sure the signal reach and fault tolerance are not impacted. Shoofly saves 40% of the hardware cost without impacting traffic demand serving.

## Pros
1. Considers the management aspect of the solution.

## Cons
1. Network telemetry operation is not defined.
