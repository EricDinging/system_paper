# Lightwave Fabrics: At-Scale Optical Circuit Switching for Datacenter and Machine Learning Systems

## Summary
This paper discusses the optical network technologies in Google's datacenters. It covers the hardware transceivers and optical circuit switches. Also, it describes the datacenter network topologies for ML workloads.

## Pros
- The paper provides detailed schematic of the hardware layout

## Cons
- The evaluation baseline is specific to Google's network. They could test against NVIDIA's topology.
- The application is limited to three LLMs in end-to-end evaluation.
