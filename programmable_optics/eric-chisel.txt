# Chisel: An optical slice of the wide-area network

## Summary
Chisel creates optical slices between WAN endpoints to avoid queueing and congestion delays inherent in packet switched paths in WANs.
Chisel leverages abundant optical spectrum and optimally allocate slices without increasing spectral fragmentation. Also Chisel consumes 3.3X fewer router ports compared to IP tunnels.

## Pros
- Take into account wavelength continuity and contiguity constraints.
- The slicing concept is relevant to 5G and 6G network nowadays.

## Cons
- Relies on the over-provisioning nature of the network, which could mean low-utilization.
