# Adapting TCP for Reconfigurable Datacenter Networks
## Summary
The paper addresses a very pressing issue that, as reconfigurable networks become faster and faster, the ramp-up delay by the TCP stack becomes more and more prominant. To solve this issue, packets are pre-buffered in ToR switch virtual output queues before the circuits are constructed. Also, congestion window size is dynamically configured through explicit circuit state feedback. Using an in-house reconfigurable network simulator, the researchers show their work could increase circuit utilization by 1.91x with only 1.20x in tail latency.

## Pros
1. The paper is well-motivated. The motivation behind dynamically ajusting buffer size and TCP congestion window is straight-forward.
2. The work explores parameters for dynamic buffer resizing including short buffer size, long buffer size, and preparation time before circuit activation for the best balance between link utilization and packet delay.


## Cons
1. Ramp-up time may exceed circuit downtime, meaning the circuit cannot be fully utilized even with pre-buffered traffic.
2. Setting ECE-echo bit requires modifying end-hosts.
3. Both techniques employed will modify congestion window. I'm not sure whether this will lead to conflict.

## Interesting points
1. Segragating elephant flows and mice flows and routing them over different network are sub-optimal.

# Jupiter Rising: A Decade of Clos Topologies and Centralized Control in Googleâ€™s Datacenter Network

## Summary
This paper shares Google's engineering experience behind ten years of production datacenter networks. It shows the general trend of moving towards centralized control plane for ease of management and high bisection bandwidth.

## Pros
1. The paper provides an interesting observation that storage placement and job scheduling have little locality in our cluster traffic for fault tolerance and power management purposes, placing extra burden on networks. 


## Cons
1. Due to the paper's nature as an industry-track paper, some of the design choices and operation details are not clearly illustrated or explained.
