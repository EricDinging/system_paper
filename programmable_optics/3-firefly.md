# FireFly: A Reconfigurable Wireless Data Center Fabric Using Free-Space Optics 

## Summary
Firefly is a novel network design using free space optics for infrastructure cost and flexibility optimization.
The work presents a small-scale proof-of-concept experiment and large-scale simulation to showcase the feasibility and cost-reduction benefit.
Firefly can achieve performance close to a full bisection bandwidth network but at 40-60% of the cost.
## Pros
1. The paper addresses practical concerns such as laser beam divergence and misalignment tolerance.
2. The author presents there small-scale prototype with long-running experiment.
3. Firefly achieves similar performance as the best network topologies but at a much lower cost.

## Cons
1. There is no complexity analysis
2. Multi-hop traffic significance is not clearly addressed.
3. Parallel configuration is not explicitly explained
4. The evaluation might use too much simulators.
5. The baseline setup is not consistent with its original design.
