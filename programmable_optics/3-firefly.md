# FireFly: A Reconfigurable Wireless Data Center Fabric Using Free-Space Optics 

## Summary

Firefly can achieve performance close to a full bisection bandwidth network but at 40-60% of the cost.
## Pros
1. laser beam divergence and misalignment tolerance
2. Small prototype with long running experiment

## Cons
1. Fiber–FSO–Fiber why fiber
2. No steering experiment
