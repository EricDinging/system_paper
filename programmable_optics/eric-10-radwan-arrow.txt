# RADWAN: Rate Adaptive Wide Area Network

## Summary
The paper argues that most of the optical fibers in WAN can achieve higher capacity due to low SNR. It also points out a conflicting point that operating at capacity threshold leads to higher failure rate. It also argues that rate adaptive design is suitable for optical links due to their stability and observability. The paper introduces RADWAN, a traffic engineering system that dynamically adjust link rates to enhance network throughput and availability.

## Pros
1. Analyze an important challenge of dynamic capacity reconfiguration: hitless capacity change.
2. The TE minimizes churn in addition to maximize throughput.

## Cons
1. The paper does not discuss the scalability of TE, especially SNR measurements.
2. The ILP formulation does not take into account signal transmission distance constraint.

# ARROW: Restoration-Aware Traffic Engineering

## Summary
The paper argues that optical link cut is not a binary event. An optical link cut is partially restorable and the routers and switches could be re-utilized. ARROW is a traffic engineering system that determines the mapping between IP flows to partially available optical links that increases the availability and the utilization of the network. Arrow uses a two-stage approach to first find the possible restoration candidates and then appropiate tunnel allocations. It's shown in simulation that Arrow supports 2x-2.4x more demand with high availability.

## Pros
1. Propose scalable lottery ticket abstraction to solve optimization problem.
## Cons
1. ROADAM could change wavelength of a network flow, potentially solving wavelength continuity constraint. The paper does not address this issue.
