# Cost-effective capacity provisioning in wide area networks with Shoofly

## Summary
The authors point out that 50% of the cross-region traffic in WAN is pass-through. However, the traffic requires optical-electrical-optical conversion, incurring hardware cost. The authors propose Shoofly to find optical bypass opportunities to reduce conversion and thus reduce hardware cost while making sure the signal reach and fault tolerance are not impacted. Shoofly saves 40% of the hardware cost without impacting traffic demand serving.

## Pros
1. Considers the management aspect of the solution.

## Cons
1. Network telemetry operation is not defined.

# Optimizing Bulk Transfers with Software-Defined Optical WAN

## Summary
Owan is a traffic management system that optimizes wide-area bulk transfers with centralized joint control of the optical and network layers.
Owan completes transfers up to 4.45×faster on average, and up to 1.36×more transfers meet their deadlines

## Pros
1. Deadline-driven controller minimizes end-to-end latency.
2. Implemented on commodity testbed.

## Cons
1. The paper does not specify application deadlines.
2. Data transfer size distribution in evaluation is not an actual reflection of actual workloads.
