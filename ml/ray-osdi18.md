# [Ray: A Distributed Framework for Emerging AI Applications](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi18-moritz.pdf)
## Problem
Support AI that continuously interact with the environment
## Challenges
- Rendering actions in milliseconds when interacting with the real world
- Support heterogeneity both in time and resource usage (CPU for simulation and GPU for training)
- Dynamic computation framework that handles millions of heterogeneous tasks per second at millisecond-level latencies
## Observations

## Ideas

## Mothods
- Distributed system with a unified interface that can express both task-parallel and actor-based computations
- Distributed scheduler, distributed fault-tolerant store to manage the system's control state
## Results

## Application
