# [Flame: Simplifying Topology Extension in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05118)
## Problem
1. Improve flexibility of FL deployments, support various topologies (hierarchical and hybrid) as well as algorithms
## Backgrounds

## Challenges


## Observations

## Ideas
1. Introduce TAG (topology abstraction graph), enables explicit customization of
individual components in the system and supports various designs
without requiring modifications to the core system components
2. Resource annotations by various providers for deployment


## Contribution
a new system that provides flexibility of the topology configuration of distributed FL applications
around the specifics of a particular deployment context, and is easily
extensible to support new FL architectures and algorithms.
