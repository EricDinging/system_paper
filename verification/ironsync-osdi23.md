# [Sharding the State Machine: Automated Modular Reasoning for Complex Concurrent Systems](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi23-hance.pdf)
## Problem
- Hard to debug concurrent code
- Aggressively optimized systems that use custom sync tools, entangling synchronization logic with application logic
- Formal verification struggle to reach production-scale shared memory systems
## Challenges

## Observations

## Ideas
- Partition system-level proof 
- IronSync developer use an ownership type system. Owned value must be held or referenced by exactly one variable
- Developer reason about the logical correctness 
- Localized transition system abstracts the state each threads act upon. Ironsycn abstracts LTS into a simplified program
- The developer writes their implementation and performs all of the reasoning above in an extended version of the Dafny
language augmented with the trusted axioms and memory primitives in IronSyncâ€™s framework

## Results

## Application

## Limitation
- IronSync does not verify liveness, termination, or deadlock-freedom.
