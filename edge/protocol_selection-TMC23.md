# [Optimal Network Protocol Selection for Competing Flows via Online Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9755209)
## Problem
- IoT dramatically expanded the range of networked devices
- Application like augmented reality require increasingly low latencies 
## Challenges
- Unpredictable, time-varying network conditions
- Competition between different flows
- A large set of protocol choices
## Backgrounds
- 5G radio access networks group the user applications into different service categories 
- Current network management practices generally rely on static pre-configurations
## Observations

## Ideas
- Dynamically network management policies that can adapt to the non-stationary protocol efficiency
- Focus on optimizing the configuration of protocol for flows on each link of a given network
- Performance-guaranteed online algorithms that can dynamically optimize protocols on each link with time-varying unknown network characteristics
## Contribution
- Formulate a total flow completion time minimization problem
