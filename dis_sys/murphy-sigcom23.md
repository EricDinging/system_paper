# [Murphy: Performance Diagnosis of Distributed Cloud Applications](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3603269.3604877?casa_token=Sc1eRh15B2kAAAAA:fkTnaOviYsyD2LXPGkjH4DwMwNa4kXxuqy3rXe0J0KTYW_-wqbEYmLHJXsGOZcQINr8xwMjMBQk)

## Problem
- Difficult to reason about cloud-based applications' performance
- Rich body of work seeks to automate performance diagnosis of enterprise networks, ignoring inter-dependencies

## Challenges

## Observations

## Ideas
- Murphy: an automated performance diagnosis system
- Work with commonly available telemetry in practical enterprise environments
- Utilize loosely-defined associations between entities obtained from commonly available monitoring data
- Learning alg is based on a Markov Random Field, reasoning about how entities affect each other in the context of a specific incident

## Results
- Reduce diagnosis error by 1.35

## Application

## Limitation
